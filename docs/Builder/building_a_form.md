# Creating a Form in Adapt Apps

To create a form, start by navigating to the Adapt Apps builder.

## Getting Started

1.  From the builder homepage or the side panel on the left, select the **Forms** tile.
2.  Click the **New Form** button on the right. This will open the form edit page.
3.  Give your new form a **Name** and click the **Save** button in the bottom-right corner.

After you've saved your form, you'll gain access to all the building tools.

## Building Your Form

1.  Go to the **Form Builder** tab. This is where you will construct the form.
2.  Select the fields you want to include in your form from the **Form Toolbox** on the left.
3.  Your selected fields will appear in the middle section of the page.

To configure a field, simply select it. Its settings will appear in a panel on the right.

### Editing Field Settings

In the settings panel, you can customize the following:

* **Field Alias:** This is the internal name for the field, used for database storage and internal references. **It must be unique.**
* **Field Title:** This is the display name that users will see on the form.
* **Field Behaviour:** Here, you can set the field to be **Hidden**, **Required**, or **Read Only**.

Some field types have additional settings. To access these, go to the tab next to "General," which will be named after your field type (e.g., "Text," "Number," "Dropdown"). This is where you can fine-tune the field's behavior with type-specific options.

Once you are satisfied with your field configurations, click the **"Save"** button on the right to save your changes.
