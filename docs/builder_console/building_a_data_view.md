# Building a Data View in Adapt Apps

## Getting Started
1. From the builder homepage or the side panel on the left, select the **Data Views** tile.
2. Click the **New View** button on the right. This will open the **View Edit Page**.
3. Give your new view a **Name** and click the **Save** button in the bottom-right corner.

After you've saved your view, you'll gain access to all the building tools.

## Building Your View
1. Go to the **View Builder** tab. This is where you will construct the view.
2. Select the fields you want to include in your view from the **Field Toolbox** on the left.
3. Your selected fields will appear in the middle section of the page and will be a column in your view table.
4. To configure a field column, simply select it and its settings will appear in a panel on the right.

## Filtering Your View
1. Next, go to the **Filter Tab** tab. This is where you can filter the items and data you want to show in your view.
2. Select a field from the **Field Toolbox**. You can now create a condition which will shape your view.
    * For example, you can choose the field **Deleted** from **Properties** and set the condition: Where Deleted Is Equal To Value No/False. This will make it so the data view only show items that have not been deleted.

## Sorting & Limiting Your View
1. Finally you can go to the **Sort & Limit** tab to sort the items in your data view.
2. Select a field and you can choose whether to order the items by Ascending or Descending.
3. You can also limit the number of items shown with the limit toggle on the right panel.

During the construction of your data view, you can preview your view to see what it will look like for users. Make sure to save your view when you're finished.
