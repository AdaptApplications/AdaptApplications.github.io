# Data Views

Data Views are a powerful way to **display and manage collected data**. They take the information submitted through your forms and present it in a clear, organised format, typically a table. This provides a central location to see all submissions for a connected form at a glance.

### Key Features of Data Views

Data views are designed to be flexible and customisable, allowing you to focus on the information you need most.

* **Customisable Columns:** You can tailor your data view to show specific information. This allows you to hide irrelevant fields and focus only on the data points that are important to you.

* **Filtering, Sorting, and Limiting:** Data views help you make sense of large datasets. You can **filter** the data to see specific entries, **sort** items based on different criteria (like date or a custom value), and **limit** the number of items displayed. This makes it easy to find and analyse specific information quickly.

* **Detailed Item View:** While the table provides a great overview, you can select any individual item to see its complete information. This is useful for reviewing all the details submitted for a single entry.
