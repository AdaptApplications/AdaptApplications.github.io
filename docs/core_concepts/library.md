# Libraries

A library serves as a centralised repository that encompasses all of your data, automations, integrations, users, and teams, providing a cohesive environment for managing resources effectively.

A library is defined as an organised collection of structured information that holds critical components such as data, security protocols, and invoicing details for each customer. This structure ensures that all relevant information is easily accessible and manageable.

New libraries can be created by only certain users, typically those with administrative privileges or specific roles that grant them the authority to establish and configure libraries. This restriction helps maintain the integrity and organisation of the library system, ensuring that only qualified individuals can make significant changes or additions.

## Library Terminology

* **Form:** A form is a structured document designed to gather specific and organised information from users, ensuring clarity and consistency in data collection.
* **Item:** An Item is a library record containing data on a single physical or digital asset, which can be created and managed within Adapt applications.
* **Timeline:** A timeline illustrates the flow of a form, highlighting key milestones and interactions, and can be utilised to automate processes by linking specific events to actions or notifications.
* **Data view:** A Data view is a dynamic, customisable representation of data extracted from a form, enabling users to analyse and interact with information in a structured manner.
* **Report:** A report is similiar to a view but can be customised and exported.

### Ownership

Libraries are owned by partners or admin users. The change of ownership can be completed by support staff. 

When a change of ownership is requested, it typically involves verifying the identity of the new owner and ensuring that they have the appropriate permissions and roles to manage the library effectively. Support staff will facilitate this process. 

This structured approach to ownership changes helps prevent unauthorised access and maintains a clear record of who is responsible for managing the library's resources.

### Creating a library

Libraries can only be created by users with administrative privileges or partner roles. This restriction ensures that the creation of new libraries is managed by individuals who have the necessary authority and understanding of the system.
