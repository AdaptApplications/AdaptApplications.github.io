# Teams

Teams are a core feature in Adapt Apps for organising users into groups. This allows for efficient management of permissions and access to various resources within a library, such as Forms, Data Views, and Items.

## Purpose of Teams

Using teams helps streamline collaboration and maintain security by ensuring users only have access to the information and functionalities relevant to their roles.

*   **User Organisation:** Group users based on their roles, departments, or specific projects. This makes it easier to manage them collectively rather than individually.

*   **Permission Management:** Assign permissions to an entire team at once. When a new user joins a team, they automatically inherit the team's permissions, simplifying the onboarding process.

*   **Controlled Access:** Restrict access to sensitive data or specific application features. For example, you can make a Data View visible only to a "Management" team or allow only the "Support" team to handle certain items.

*   **Workflow Assignment:** Assign tasks or items to a team, allowing any member of that team to pick up and work on the task. This promotes flexibility and ensures work is completed efficiently.

## Managing Teams

Team management is typically handled by users with administrative privileges, such as **Admin** or **Partner** users. They can create new teams, add or remove members, and configure team-specific permissions through the User Management section of the application.

This centralised control ensures that team structures remain organised and aligned with your organisation's policies.
