## About Libraries

A library serves as a centralized repository that encompasses all of your data, automations, integrations, users, and teams, providing a cohesive environment for managing resources effectively.

A library is defined as an organized collection of structured information that holds critical components such as data, security protocols, and invoicing details for each customer. This structure ensures that all relevant information is easily accessible and manageable.

New libraries can be created by only certain users, typically those with administrative privileges or specific roles that grant them the authority to establish and configure libraries. This restriction helps maintain the integrity and organization of the library system, ensuring that only qualified individuals can make significant changes or additions.

### Ownership

Libraries are owned by partners or admin users. The change of ownership can be completed by support staff. 

When a change of ownership is requested, it typically involves verifying the identity of the new owner and ensuring that they have the appropriate permissions and roles to manage the library effectively. Support staff will facilitate this process. 

This structured approach to ownership changes helps prevent unauthorized access and maintains a clear record of who is responsible for managing the library's resources.
