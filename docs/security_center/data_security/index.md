# Data Security

At Adapt Applications, we are deeply committed to protecting our customers' data. Our comprehensive data security program is designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your information. This document outlines the key pillars of our data security strategy.

## Data Encryption

We employ robust encryption measures to protect data both in transit and at rest.

### Encryption in Transit
All data transmitted between you and our services is encrypted using industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher. This ensures that your data is protected from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Encryption at Rest
Data stored on our servers, including database records, files, and backups, is encrypted at rest using AES-256, one of the strongest block ciphers available.

## Access Control

We enforce strict access control policies to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Access to data and systems is governed by the principle of least privilege. Our Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model ensures that individuals only have access to the information and resources necessary to perform their job functions.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Access to sensitive systems and data requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), adding an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Our Data Loss Prevention (DLP) strategies are designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. We use a combination of automated scanning tools and manual processes to identify and protect sensitive data.

## Incident Response

We have a well-defined incident response plan to promptly address any security incidents. Our security team is on call 24/7 to respond to alerts and potential threats. In the event of a security breach, we are committed to transparent communication and will notify affected customers in accordance with our legal and contractual obligations.
