### 3. SERVICES

3.0 Adapt Apps may provide the opportunity for Customer to create its own Access Credentials including a User ID and password to enable it to access and use the Services.

3.3 Where the functionality is available, Customer may add and deactivate Users at any time directly through User Interface (and Customer shall simultaneously notify its Adapt Apps Liaison Officer of each addition or deactivation).

3.4 Customer will not give User identifications and passwords to its contractors, subcontractors or other agents and will not otherwise allow its contractors, subcontractors or other agents access to the Services without Adapt Apps prior written consent.

Where the functionality is available, Customer must also submit a request to the support portal notifying Adapt Apps that Customer wishes to substitute Users (and Customer shall simultaneously notify its account manager via email of each substitution).

3.6 If Customer substitutes a User using the support portal, Customer will only be charged for one User and will not be charged for both the new User and the substituted User, even if the substituted User's credentials are still associated with the Services in the Adapt Apps Platform (but as long as such substituted User is no longer active at the relevant time). Without derogating from clause 3.5, User substitutions can only be applied to Users within the same billing category.

3.7 Adapt Apps may terminate or suspend any User's access to the Services, if in its sole discretion, it determines that such User has:

(c) hacked or otherwise accessed or used the Services or its data or any portion thereof (including the underlying technology) except through a standard web browser and the Adapt Apps website as described in Adapt Apps User materials, or

(d) otherwise taken any action that is a violation of these GTCs.

(b) Customer must not permit any unauthorised person or application to access or use the Services;

(c) Customer must not republish or redistribute any content or material from the Services, other than in accordance with Adapt Apps prior written consent;

(d) Customer must not make any alteration to the Platform, except as permitted by the Documentation; and

(e) Customer must not conduct or request that any other person conduct any load testing or penetration testing on the Platform or the Services without Adapt Apps prior written consent.

3.12 Customer must not use the Services in any way that causes, or may cause, damage to the Services or Platform or impairment of the availability or accessibility of the Services.

3.13 Customer must not use the Services in any way that uses excessive Platform resources and as a result is liable to cause a material degradation in the Services provided by Adapt Apps to other customers using the Platform, and Customer acknowledges that Adapt Apps may use reasonable technical measures to limit Customer's use of Platform resources for the purpose of assuring Services to Adapt Apps customers generally.

3.17 Adapt Apps may improve, amend or change the Services at their sole discretion, but may not make any change that negatively affects the Services in a material way without providing prior written notice to Customer. If Adapt Apps makes any change that negatively affects the Services in a material way, the Customer may terminate the affected Services without penalty.

4.0 Adapt Apps may, on prior written Notice to Customer, integrate the Services with any Third Party Services at any time as may be required for Adapt Apps to supply the Services.

4.1 The supply of Third Party Services to Customer is governed by a separate contract, arrangement or agreement between Customer and the relevant third party.
