## Orders

### Order constitutes offer
By placing an order through this site, you make an offer to us to purchase the services that you have selected pursuant to these Website Terms of Use. Information contained in this site constitutes an invitation to treat only. No information in this site constitutes an offer by us to supply any services to you – however, the Company will endeavour to supply your selected services to you.

We will not commence processing any order made through this site unless and until:
- payment for the order has been received by us in full; and
- the order has passed our internal validation procedures, which are undertaken in order to verify the bona fides of each order for the purpose of preventing credit card and other fraud.

We reserve the right at our discretion to:
- at any time prior to your order being accepted in accordance with these Website Terms of Use, cancel all or part of your order; and
- at any time:
  - refuse to provide services to you;
  - terminate your access to this site; and/or
  - remove or edit any content on this site.

### Acceptance of orders
Acceptance of each order will take place if and when the Company either:
- provides the services to you, at the time at which the Company commences providing the services; or
- notifies you in writing that your order has been accepted, at the time at which such notification is sent by the Company.

### Prices
The Company reserves the right to change the prices for services displayed in this site at any time before you place an order.

### GST
All prices listed on this website are in Australian Dollars (AUD) and are inclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST). Any fees or charges, including shipping costs, also include GST where applicable.
"GST" has the meaning given to it in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth).

### Payment methods
Payment for orders placed through this site may be made:
- by credit card (Visa or MasterCard only) processed online using  secure Stripe payment gateway;
- via direct bank deposit by electronic funds transfer (EFT).

### Stripe secure payment gateway
The Company uses the third-party payment gateway provided by Stripe Payments Australia Pty Ltd (ABN 66 160 180 343) trading as "Stripe" for its secure online payment transactions. Payments made through Stripe are subject to Stripe’s own terms and conditions and privacy policy. For more information about Stripe, see the Stripe website (http://www.stripe.com/).
Unless you expressly consent otherwise, we do not see or have access to any personal information that you may provide to Stripe, other than information that is required in order to process your order and deliver your purchased items to you (eg, your name, email address and billing address).

### Credit and debit card payments
Only VISA and MasterCard are accepted. Please note that we may be unable to accept credit cards issued by banks outside of Australia in some cases. The Company does not charge additional transaction fees for paying by credit card.

### Payment by EFT
If you elect to pay for an order by direct deposit using EFT, after your order has been submitted, we will send you an email containing instructions for making the payment, or otherwise provide such information to you, including our bank account details and the reference number for your order. Please quote the reference number for the EFT transaction in order to avoid delays in processing your order.

### Refunds and other remedies
Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Website Terms of Use and required under the Australian Consumer Law, all amounts paid through this site are non-refundable. Further information on the steps that the Company will take to remedy any breach of any non-excludable condition or warranty/guarantee is provided under the heading "Remedies limited" in these Website Terms of Use below.

### Security
While our website hosting providers employ secure technology for transactions with our customers, we will not be responsible for any damages, including consequential losses (whether direct or indirect), that may be suffered by a customer whose credit or debit card or bank account information is used in a fraudulent or unauthorised manner by any person other than the Company.
The Company may request further information from you, such as a copy of your credit card and/or other identification documentation, as part of our internal validation procedures. These procedures help protect bank and credit card account holders from online fraud. Until your order has passed our internal fraud prevention checks, your order will remain on pending status. If further information is requested and you do not provide the requested information within such time as the Company considers appropriate at its discretion, your order will be cancelled and, if your payment has been received, it will be refunded back to you.
