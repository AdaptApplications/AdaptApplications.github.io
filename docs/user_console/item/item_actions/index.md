# Item Actions
When viewing an item in the User Console, you'll find a suite of actions available to manage and track its progress. These actions are designed to provide comprehensive control and visibility over your item's lifecycle:

### Timeline
The **Timeline** section displays the current workflow timeline that the item is associated with.

### Status
The **Status** indicates the specific stage within the item's timeline that it currently occupies. You can select this stage, and if a manual transition is configured from the current stage, you have the option to change it to the next appropriate stage in the workflow.

### Share
The **Share** feature provides a unique link to the public item page for this specific item. This link can be shared with external users or collaborators, allowing them to view and potentially update the item remotely, even if they don't have direct access to adapt apps.

### Item Comments
The **Item Comments** section allows users within the Adapt app who have appropriate access to leave comments directly on this item. This creates a collaborative space where discussions and notes related to the item can be tracked. The entire comment trail can be viewed here, providing a historical record of all discussions.

### Audit Trail
The **Audit Trail** provides a comprehensive log of all updates and changes that this item has undergone throughout its lifecycle. This detailed history includes valuable information such as:
- **Timeline Progression:** When and how the item moved between different stages in its workflow.
- **API Responses:** Records of any API interactions related to the item, including successful responses and potential errors.
- **Error Messages:** Details of any errors encountered during item processing or updates.
- **Item Update Details:** Specific changes made to the item's data, including who made the change and when.
The audit trail is crucial for tracking accountability, troubleshooting issues, and understanding the complete history of an item.

### Refresh
The **Refresh** button allows you to instantly update the current item's data to reflect the latest information available. This is useful to ensure you are always viewing the most current state of the item, especially if other users or automated processes might be making changes.

### Item Menu
The **Item Menu** provides access to various settings and actions specific to the item. Currently, the primary function available here is the option to **delete the item**.
