# Viewing Notifications
The Notifications page provides a comprehensive overview of all alerts and notifications within your Adapt Applications. You can easily distinguish between read and unread notifications to prioritise your attention.

## Understanding Notification Status

*   **Unread Notifications:** These are new alerts or updates that you have not yet viewed. They are typically highlighted or marked with a distinct indicator (ee.g., a bold title or a colored dot) to draw your attention.
*   **Read Notifications:** These are alerts or updates that you have previously opened or marked as read. They usually appear in a standard format, indicating that you have acknowledged them.

## Filtering and Sorting Notifications

To help you manage your notifications effectively, the Notifications page often includes options to filter and sort them:

*   **Filter by Status:** You can typically filter notifications to display only "Unread," "Read," or "All" notifications. This allows you to focus on what's new or review past alerts.
*   **Sort by Date:** Notifications are usually sorted by date by default, with the most recent appearing first. You may have options to sort in ascending or descending order.
*   **Sort by Severity:** If applicable, you might be able to sort notifications by their severity level (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) to address the most urgent issues first.

## Marking Notifications as Read/Unread

You can usually manage the read status of your notifications:

*   **Mark as Read:** Clicking on an unread notification will typically mark it as read. There might also be an option to "Mark All as Read" to clear all new notifications at once.
*   **Mark as Unread:** If you need to revisit a notification later, you might have the option to mark a read notification back to "Unread."

By effectively utilising these features, you can ensure you stay informed about critical events and manage your workflow efficiently within Adapt Applications.
