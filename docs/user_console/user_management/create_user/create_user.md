    Selecting *Send* will send an onboarding link to the new user, where they can go through the steps to create their Adapt Apps account.

    **Note:** Email functionality for sending onboarding links is currently under development and will be available soon. For now, please use the *Copy Link* feature and share it directly with the users you wish to add.
