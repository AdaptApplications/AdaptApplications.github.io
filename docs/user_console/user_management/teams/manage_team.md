## Navigating to a Team

1.  Go to **Manage Users**.
2.  Click on the **Edit Teams** tab.
3.  Click on the name of the team you wish to manage from the list.

This will take you to the team's detail page, where you can perform the following actions.

## Adding Members to a Team

4.  Select the user(s) you want to add. You can often search for users by name or email.

## Deleting a Team

Deleting a team is a permanent action and cannot be undone.

2.  You will be asked to confirm the deletion, as this action is irreversible.
3.  Once confirmed, the team will be permanently removed. Any permissions or assignments linked directly to the team will also be removed.
